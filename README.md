# Twitter-Discord-Bot
This was my first time implementing the Twitter Stream API and creating a Discord Bot. Essentially, the goal was to use the Twitter Stream API to filter through new tweets related to the Ethereum Merge and provide the Tweet URLs to a Discord channel. The client.run() method causes a runtime error once the bot has been closed, so I attempted in vain to make a wrapper function to silence the error. Any suggestions on how to fix this are greatly appreciated.

Run the twitter_tweets.py for it to work.
